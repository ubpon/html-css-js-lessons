## What are Semantic Elements?

A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

## Advantage

Examples of semantic elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.

## Disadvantage

Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.
